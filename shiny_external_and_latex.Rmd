This is using the approach found [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html)



```{r load_packages, include=FALSE}
library(shiny)
```

Here is a test equation
---------

$$
X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n} \sim N(\mu,\sigma^{2})
$$


Here is a test shiny app
---------
```{r, echo = FALSE}
source('shiny_app_example.r')
shiny_app_example()
```
